# Giphy Search App
The purpose of this project was to provide a web application with following specimens
• Display the results as still thumbnails on the page in a layout that you find sensible.
• A large volume of results should load in a performance-minded fashion - consider
paginating your results in any form you’d like
• Clicking on a thumbnail should launch a modal which allows the user to browse
through individual GIF renditions. The renditions in this view should be fully animated
• Provide a way for the user to perform a keyword search against the API
